# Semantic Segmentation of Urban Street Scenes

> **Motivation:**
> - The problem of scene understanding is a difficult one.
> - Despite this complexity, the ability to correctly analyse the environment is critical for the development of autonomous systems such as self-driving cars.
> - I want to develop a model for semantically understanding urban street scenes.


**Description:**

 - The aim of my project is to implement a deep neural network in the Wolfram Language which can perform a pixel-wise semantic segmentation of the images contained in the Cityscapes dataset.
 - The dataset used is a challenging one consisting of a comprehensive set of images from various kinds of urban settings.

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Proposed Methodology

The images will be fed into a convolutional neural network, which will learn to classify each pixel as belonging to one of 30 classes of objects.
